## Question 4 : multivariate analysis and unsupervised learning methods

## Use dataset available on 'http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/data/hybrid_reg.csv' , then:

## Read in the NFL dataset
link='http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/data/hybrid_reg.csv'
datasetHyb=read.csv(link)
nrow(datasetHyb)
head(datasetHyb)
tail(datasetHyb)
str(datasetHyb)


## Question 5 (a) Use LDA to classify the dataset into few classes so that at
## least 85% of information of dataset is explained through
## new classification. (Hint: model the output variable
## “carclass_id” to input variables “msrp”, “accelrate”, and
## “mpg”). How many LDs do you choose? Explain the
## reason.

table(datasetHyb$carclass_id)

datasetHyb.lda = lda(carclass_id~msrp+accelrate+mpg, data = datasetHyb)
datasetHyb.lda

#Proportion of trace:
#  LD1    LD2    LD3 
#0.6945 0.2002 0.1053

# Choose two LDs - together they give approx 90% (at least 85% required in question)



# Question 5 (b) Apply PCA to input variables, and identify the important
# principle components involving at least 90% of dataset
# variation. Explain your decision strategy? Plot principle
# components versus their variance (Hint: to sketch the plot
# use the Scree plot).

dsHyb2 = datasetHyb[4:6]
head(dsHyb2)

dsHyb2.pc = princomp(dsHyb2, cor = TRUE)
summary(dsHyb2.pc)

# Cumulative Proportion  0.7199935 0.8988829 1.0000000

# All three components important

# Scree Plot principle components against variance
loadings(dsHyb2.pc)
plot(dsHyb2.pc, type = "lines")

biplot(dsHyb2.pc)



## Question 5 (c) Use K-means clustering analysis to input variables and
## identify the most important classes. How many classes do
## you select? Why?

wssplot <- function(dsHyb2, nc=10, seed=2343){
   
       wss <- (nrow(dsHyb2)-1) * sum(apply(dsHyb2, 2, var))
       
         for (i in 2 : nc){
             
               set.seed(seed)
             wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(dsHyb2, centers = i)$withinss)
             
             }
       
         plot(1:nc, wss, type = "b", xlab = "Numbers of Clusters", ylab = "Within Groups Sum of Squares")
       
         
 }
 

wssplot(dsHyb2)


# Cluster = 3

dsHyb2.k = kmeans(dsHyb2,3)
attributes(dsHyb2.k)
# Centroids(arithmetic mean) 
dsHyb2.k$centers
# Cluster size: 
dsHyb2.k$size



# Question 5 (d) Split the dataset into two sets of variables so that 
# X=(msrp, mpgmpge) and Y=( accelrate, mpg). Apply canonical
# correlation analysis to find the cross-correlation between X
# and Y. What is the correlation between msrp and mpg?

X <- cbind(datasetHyb$msrp, datasetHyb$mpgmpge)
Y <- cbind(datasetHyb$accelrate, datasetHyb$mpg)

cor(X, Y)

#[,1]       [,2]
#[1,]  0.6955779 -0.5318264
#[2,] -0.3988673  0.6677531

# Correlation between msrp and mpg = -0.5318264
