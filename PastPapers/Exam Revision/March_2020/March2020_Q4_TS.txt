## Question 4 : Use data('EuStockMarkets') to load the in-built 
## dataset 'EuStockMarkets' in R, consider DAX as your time series variable:

df = data.frame(EuStockMarkets)



## (a) Validate the assumptions using graphical visualization.


t <- df$DAX
tsDax <- ts(t)
plot(tsDax)


abline(reg=lm(df$DAX~time(df$DAX)), col="blue") # line for the mean of time series
qqnorm(df$DAX)



tsDaxDiff = diff(tsDax)
plot(tsDaxDiff)


tsDaxLogDiff = diff(log(tsDax))
plot(tsDaxLogDiff)


ggqqplot(tsDax)




##(b) Fit the optimized ARIMA model for DAX and provide the coefficient estimates for the fitted model.

#p,d,q

acf(tsDaxLogDiff)  # gives us q = 1


pacf(tsDaxLogDiff) # gives us p = 0

fit.manual = arima(tsDax, c(0,1,1))
fit.manual

fit.auto = auto.arima(tsDax, seasonal = F)
fit.auto

fit.auto = auto.arima(tsDax, seasonal = T)
fit.auto


# Manual fit is better




## (c) What is the estimated order for AR and MA?

# MA = q = 1
# AR = p = 0





## (d) Forecast h=10 step ahead prediction of DAX 
## on the plot of the original time series.

arima.forecast = forecast(fit.manual, h = 10)
summary(arima.forecast)
plot(arima.forecast)
