## All questions were solved/analysed using RStudio Cloud
## All question use the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. This is a well known dataset in academic cricles and 
## requires relatively little introduction.

## For the purposes of this CA it contained a sufficient mix of discrete and continous variables and just enough
## data rows on which to perform visual, and other analysis. The size of the dataset meant that processing 
## overhead would not be an issue while developing the solutions.

## Question 1 uses an R Shiny dashboard

## Questions 2 and 3 are developed as standard R files in RStudio Cloud. They are run individually.

## For simplicity, each Question solution loads its own copy of the Pima Indian dataset CSV file from within the 
## same directory as the R file for that question.

## Question One : The solution is presented via a Shiny R Dashbaord, using elements of the Semantic UI library.
###############################################################################################################

## To run. 

 - Navigate from the root folder to The 'QuestionOne' folder.
 
 - Run the 'Question_1_RUNME.r' program. This is just a simple script to execute the Shiny R dashbaord program in the 'CA Dashbaord' folder.
 
 - The dashboard is a Shiny R application. Both the Shuny UI Function and Shiny Server function are contained in the same 'app.r' file. This type of construction is possible
 in later versions of R.
 
 - The app.r rile starts routines to load anc lean up the Pima Indian datsset. Hence the number of rows in the 'active' dataset in the question solutions is less
 than the original size.
 
 - Additional small bespoke R functions have also been written by me (before the location of Shiny UI/Server function in the file) in order to streamline some of the
 analysis.
 
 - Routines from the Semantic UI library were included to add richness to the Shiny R dashboard. 
 
 - Each sub section of the answers to Question 1 are presented in a seperate tab on the dashboard.

## Question Two : The solution is presented as an R rile.
###############################################################################################################

## To run. 

 - Navigate from the root folder to The 'QuestionTwo' folder.
 
 - Run the 'Question_2_MODELS.r' program. 
 
 - The output from the R file in RStudio/R Studio Cloud will present the analysis, which is expanded on in the 
 comments within the R script.
 
 
###############################################################################################################
## Question Three : The solution is presented as an R rile.
###############################################################################################################


## To run. 

 - Navigate from the root folder to The 'QuestionThree' folder. 
 
 - Run the 'Question_3_GLM.r' program. 
 
 - The output from the R file in RStudio/R Studio Cloud will present the analysis, which is expanded on in the 
 comments within the R script.
